Another year went by - Year 6 of my software development journey! I wanted to write this blog post to sum up stuff that I've done or learned this year. Keep in mind this is being written off the top of my head - I did not keep a journal throughout the year, but hopefully that's something I'll do in 2020.

## Complexity is your enemy

As programmers, we are puzzle-solvers. We like to think outside the box, applying different concepts, putting all of those nice things we've learned everywhere. This.... often backfires. Most of the time what works best are the simplest solutions, which are also easier to maintain in the future by you or others. I've seen this quote somewhere a while back: "Programmers spend the first years of their careers mastering complexity only to realize they should master simplicity instead". I guess I'm not in my first years anymore?

I've changed my process in writing code to this:

1. Understand the problem/goal;
2. Draw a simple mental picture of how to solve it (really simplify it);
3. Code in small steps and test them as you go;
4. Make it work. Code can look quite ugly in this step;
5. Optimize it, performance-wise;
6. ⭐️ Try to explain how it works to yourself (mentally or by text), and then refactor the code to be as simple as possible;
