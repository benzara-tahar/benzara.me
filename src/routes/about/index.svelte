		When it comes to business, first impressions matter, and good website design is the key to
		capitalizing on them. An excellent site is not judged solely on its looks, but on its
		functionality and usability as well. My experience as a programmer allows me to come up with
		intelligent solutions to technical challenges, while at the same time designing sleek and
		visually appealing websites. Aside from having extensive knowledge of recognized technical
		standards, I am conversant with modern building practices.
